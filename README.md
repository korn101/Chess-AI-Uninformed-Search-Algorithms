Uninformed Search Algorithms and Greedy Search


In this practical a task is given to develop a simple artificial intelligence to play an end-game scenario against the StockFish AI using elementary search techniques. In order to realise the decision tree, it will be recursively constructed to required depth for this practical - depth 4. ie. 4 moves for each player after the start of end game.
